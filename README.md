## AES Password Manager

Keep your secret keys safe with this password manager powered by Electron through Astilectron and GoLang.


Enter your secret key, use AES key lengths: 128, 192 or 256 bits. If it's the first login a data file will be created at the current folder. The file will store your login credentials.
